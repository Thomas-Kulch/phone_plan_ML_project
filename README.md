# Megaline - Phone Plan ML Project

In this project, I will be testing my introductory Machine Learning skills by:
    
    - Splitting a dataset into training, test and validation sets
    - Investigating the quality of different models 
    - Reporting my findings on which model works best for this task

I use the sklearn library with several modules as well as the pandas library.
